/*
Shipping Cost Calculator with US Dollar

-Ask the user for Package dimension in inches
-length, height, width - This should be integers
-All package must be 10 inches or less otherwise we can't ship it.

-Base Cost 2.50
-if package volume is greater than 100 cubic inches, There is a 10% Surcharge
-if package volume is greater than 500 cubic inches, There is a 25% Surcharge
