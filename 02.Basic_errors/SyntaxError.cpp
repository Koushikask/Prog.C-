include<iostream>
    // #include<iostream> That's the correct syntax for including header files.
    using namespace std;

int main()
{
    in one{1};
    // int one{1}; There's no such keyword like "in" in C++. So, that's the correct one.

    cout << "Hello World;
        // cout<<"Hello World"; That's the correct one. We forgot to add double inverted comma at the end of Wrold.

        return 0;
